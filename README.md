## üõ† Getting Started (Run Locally)

To run this project on your machine:

1.  Clone/download the Repository
2.  Create virtual environment (optional)
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

    or just load it on you code editor

3.  Install dependencies

    pip install pandas streamlit imdbpy

4.  Run the app
    streamlit run app.py

5.  You can now use the app in your browser at http://localhost:8501. Have fun, i guess.

NB: You really only need the app.py and the final_movie_info.csv files. The scraper.ipynb file is basically what is it; the file where i scrapped the info i used and read it into a csv file. The other CSV files are earlier movie info files.
